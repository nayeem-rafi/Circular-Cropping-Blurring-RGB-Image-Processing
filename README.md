# Circular Cropping Blurring RGB Image Processing
 This MATLAB script allows users to crop an image in a circular region and apply a Gaussian blur to that area. The user selects the center and edge of the circular region interactively. A Gaussian filter is then applied to blur the selected area, and the final image with the blurred circular crop is displayed.
